# Instructions on how to setup and run the algorithm desribed in "A multi-resolution method to map and identify locations of future gully and channel incision".

The algorithm was written using an Anconda 3.7 (https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) installation with the following dependencies:

GDAL: https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/gdal

xarray: https://anaconda.org/anaconda/xarray

Landlab: http://landlab.github.io/#/

All of the above can be installed using the conda package manager.

Data to test the algorithm is available here https://elevation.fsdf.org.au/

File reading and writing is setup assuming inputs are in standard Geotiff format.
